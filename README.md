# Coffee Shop

This is a simple web application that allows you to manage your coffee roasting business. The main goal of this small project is to build by adding offline capabilities using the latest web storage APIs! Also going beyond localStorage to use newer and more performant APIs like IndexedDB for storing JSON, CacheStorage for caching requests, and the FileSystem API for accessing the local file system. There are hands-on experience with client-side storage, quotas, and persistence for different browsers (mainly Chrome, Firefox and Safari).
